Fiber is very good for health, helping to improve digestion and aid in weight loss. The fiber in fruit, especially soluble fiber, works to lower cholesterol levels, slow down the absorption of carbs, and increase satiety. Studies also show that soluble fiber can help you lose weight healthily.

In particular, the antioxidants and plant compounds found in the fruit rich in vitamins A, C, E, beta-carotene, lycopene and selenium help prevent or limit the damage caused by free radicals. As a result, it is possible to prevent the risk of diseases: cancer, diabetes, heart disease and stroke.
